# Telegram Spam Filter Chrome Extension
This Chrome extension provides a simple **spam filtering solution** for the **Telegram web application**.

The extension also adds a custom "Spam" button to the header, which can be clicked to toggle the visibility of the spam container.

- If **unread message count** is above 1000
- **Hides messages** containing the specified keywords from the main chat window
- Clones and moves spam messages to a separate spam container

- Periodically **checks for new messages** and processes them accordingly
